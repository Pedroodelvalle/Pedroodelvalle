## Context

In a world increasingly dominated by AI, authenticity becomes the last frontier. That's what we're building at Conty: a platform where anyone can earn money promoting products they genuinely love, naturally and spontaneously, just by sharing their story.

We're creating the "Uber" of the creator economy — connecting brands with authentic voices at scale.
